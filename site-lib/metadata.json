The \"actant/actor\" are used sometimes interchangeably, but the distinction can also be a key tool in ANT for analyzing the unfolding of <a data-href=\"agency\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/philosophy/agency.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">agency</a> <a data-href=\"@matozziWhatCanANT2019\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@matozziwhatcanant2019.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"matozziWhatCanANT2019\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Matozzi, 2019)p.94). These entities participating in the action are not strictly (intentional) humans, but extends to include the \"nonhumans\", i.e. anything that makes a difference <a data-href=\"@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourreassemblingsocialintroduction2005.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 2005)p.71-72).<br>Crucially for ANT, the term actor in \"<a data-href=\"actor-network\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/ant-and-after/actor-network.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">actor-network</a>\" is intentionally oxymoronic, embodying the tension between a centered \"actor\" and a decentered \"network\", thus eliding the distinction between \"agency\" and \"structure\" <a data-href=\"@lawAntComplexityNaming1999\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@lawantcomplexitynaming1999.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"lawAntComplexityNaming1999\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Law, 1999)p.5). A defining aspect for both of them in ANT is that they make a difference. If an entity makes no difference, it is not considered an actor but a passive <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Intermediaries and Mediators\" data-href=\"Intermediaries and Mediators\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/ant-and-after/intermediaries-and-mediators.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">intermediary</a>. An actor is thus what is not entirely substitutable. <a data-href=\"@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourreassemblingsocialintroduction2005.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 2005)p.130;153.)<br>\"Actant\" is often used when the entity does not yet have a specific figuration or identity beyond its capacity to act <a data-href=\"@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourreassemblingsocialintroduction2005.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 2005)p.71). Generally, it is used to point to \"anything that acts\" regardless of its <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Ontology\" data-href=\"Ontology\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/philosophy/ontology.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ontological</a> status, size, scale, or features, providing a descriptive term for the principle of symmetry <a data-href=\"@matozziWhatCanANT2019\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@matozziwhatcanant2019.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"matozziWhatCanANT2019\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Matozzi, 2019)p.94). Actant is then a slightly broader term than actor, and often used in a more general and symmetrical way to include anything that participates in a network and influences outcomes, particularly before a stable identity or figuration is established.<br>\"Actor\" can then denote an actant with more specific features, relationships, and a recognized role within the network. Actor can be understood as an actant that possesses additional features and engages in various relations beyond simply performing an action. While anything that acts is an actant, what acts is not reducible solely to the performed action. For example <a data-href=\"@akrichSummaryConvenientVocabulary1992\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@akrichsummaryconvenientvocabulary1992.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"akrichSummaryConvenientVocabulary1992\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Akrich &amp; Latour, 1992), a written note and a weight can both function as the same actant by reminding a hotel guest to return the key. However, in the given example they are different actors with distinct physical characteristics and may contribute differently to the hotel manager's goals.<br>Figuration gives actants \"flesh and features that make them have some form or shape, no matter how vague\". These are not limited to anthropomorphic forms; they can also be e.g. ideo- or technomorphic. An actor is an actant that has been given a specific figuration. In ANT process, the analysis often involves moving from the identification of actants to the figuration of actors with more defined roles and attributes within a network. Therefore, the figuration that distinguishes the actor from the actant is one that endows the actant with specific characteristics, attributes agency to it, or positions it within a network in a defined way, moving beyond the basic definition of \"anything that acts\". <a data-href=\"@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourreassemblingsocialintroduction2005.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 2005)p.53-55.)<br>ANT treats actors symmetrically by employing a methodological principle known as <a data-href=\"generalized symmetry\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/ant-and-after/generalized-symmetry.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">generalized symmetry</a>. This principle suggests that when studying a situation or a network, researchers should remain agnostic regarding what counts as an actor and should not a priori assume that humans and nonhumans have fundamentally different types of agency or causal power. <a data-href=\"@lawMethodMessSocial2004\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@lawmethodmesssocial2004.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"lawMethodMessSocial2004\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Law, 2004)p.101-103;<a data-href=\"@callonElementsSociologyTranslation1986\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@callonelementssociologytranslation1986.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"callonElementsSociologyTranslation1986\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Callon, 1986)p.201.)<br>ANT also proposes that <a data-href=\"agency\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/philosophy/agency.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">agency</a> is not an inherent property of individual actors (whether human or nonhuman) but rather an emergent effect of the relationships and associations within a network <a data-href=\"@nimmoActorNetworkTheoryMethodology2011\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@nimmoactornetworktheorymethodology2011.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"nimmoActorNetworkTheoryMethodology2011\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor.md\"></span></a>(Nimmo, 2011)p.112).

Ultimately, a network in ANT is not a static thing, but rather the recorded movement of a thing. It is a concept or tool used for description, not the thing being described <a data-href=\"@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourreassemblingsocialintroduction2005.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor-Network.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 2005)p.131). The actor-network then serves as a concept or a tool for describing how social phenomena are assembled and ordered.<br>ANT challenges the concepts of Euclideanism and regionalism, which assume the world is a surface or volume divisible into principalities. It argues that entities and materials do not exist within a conformable three-dimensional space or in fixed geographical areas. ANT proposes a change in topology where entities are understood as nodes that possess as many dimensions as they have connections. In this alternative topological system, elements retain their spatial integrity by virtue of their position within a set of links or relations, rather than their volume. <a data-href=\"@lawAntComplexityNaming1999\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@lawantcomplexitynaming1999.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"lawAntComplexityNaming1999\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor-Network.md\"></span></a>(Law, 1999).<br>ANT's topology is thus non-Euclidean. Inspired by Deleuze's \"rhizomes\", <a data-href=\"@latourActornetworkTheoryFew1996\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latouractornetworktheoryfew1996.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourActornetworkTheoryFew1996\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor-Network.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 1996) suggests that modern societies possess a \"fibrous, thread-like, wiry, stringy, ropy, capillary character\" that cannot be captured by traditional notions of structure, layers, territories, spheres or categories. ANT aims to \"reshuffle spatial metaphors\" such as close and far, up and down, local and global, replacing them with associations and connections (ibid.). This results in a ontologically \"flattened landscape\" where the former global and local sites take on a \"star-shaped aspect,\" existing side-by-side rather than hierarchically ordered within a three-dimensional structure <a data-href=\"@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourreassemblingsocialintroduction2005.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor-Network.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 2005)p.212-213).<br>From this perspective, ANT posits that there is \"nothing but networks\" and no \"aether\" in which networks should be immersed, thus the focus is on connections and transformations rather than fixed substances or structures <a data-href=\"@latourActornetworkTheoryFew1996\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latouractornetworktheoryfew1996.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourActornetworkTheoryFew1996\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor-Network.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 1996)<a data-href=\"@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourreassemblingsocialintroduction2005.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/ANT and After/Actor-Network.md\"></span></a>(Latour, 2005)p.107).

These actor-networks, characterized by heterogeneity and hybridity, are enacted through processes of translation, where e.g. inscriptions and quasi-objects facilitate interactions via intermediaries and mediators. Through enrolment, actants are integrated, and often networks have obligatory passage points where all actors must converge. Immutable mobiles and objects stabilize and disseminate influence, revealing the multiplicity inherent in social and material realities. Complex networks are often simplified into punctualised black boxes, which the ANT tries to provide a view into.\n<br>ANT does not use \"<a data-href=\"society\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/other/society.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">society</a>\" or \"social\" as explanations in its analysis, but instead tries to explain them \"in the making\" as an ongoing achievement.

A digital garden is a metaphor for an online space where thoughts, ideas, and notes are cultivated and interconnected over time. In online space it's distinct e.g. from a traditional blog in several key ways. Unlike many types of texts, which are typically published and then left as static pieces, digital garden entries are meant to be living documents that are constantly updated, revised, and expanded upon. The focus is on the process of developing ideas, rather than presenting finished products.<br>Digital gardens often utilize extensive internal linking to create a network of interconnected ideas. This somewhat resembles the idea of <a data-href=\"pattern language\" href=\"literature-survey/methodology/pattern-language.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">pattern language</a> and allows readers to explore related concepts and follow the evolution of the author's thinking. This linking creates a non linear way of navigating the information. Digital gardens are often highly personal spaces where individuals can explore their own interests and develop their own unique perspectives. It is a place for the author to cultivate their own thoughts.In essence, a digital garden is a space for continuous learning, reflection, and connection, where ideas are nurtured and allowed to grow organically.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["?query=tag:partiallyAIgenerated","literature-survey/methodology/pattern-language.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"literature-survey/methodology/digital-garden.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1741366356362,"modifiedTime":1744132078548,"sourceSize":1813,"sourcePath":"Literature Survey/Methodology/Digital Garden.md","exportPath":"literature-survey/methodology/digital-garden.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"literature-survey/methodology/ethnography.html":{"title":"Ethnography","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"literature-survey/methodology/ethnography.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1737617285531,"modifiedTime":1737617293734,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Literature Survey/Methodology/Ethnography.md","exportPath":"literature-survey/methodology/ethnography.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"literature-survey/methodology/method-assemblage.html":{"title":"Method Assemblage","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"literature-survey/methodology/method-assemblage.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1741529286797,"modifiedTime":1741529286797,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Literature Survey/Methodology/Method Assemblage.md","exportPath":"literature-survey/methodology/method-assemblage.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"literature-survey/methodology/pattern-language.html":{"title":"Pattern Language","icon":"","description":"<a href=\".?query=tag:partiallyAIgenerated\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#partiallyAIgenerated\">#partiallyAIgenerated</a> <br>The concept of pattern language was popularized by architect Christopher Alexander and his colleagues in their book, \"A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction\" <a data-href=\"@alexanderPatternLanguageTowns1977\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@alexanderpatternlanguagetowns1977.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">@alexanderPatternLanguageTowns1977</a>.

Design Guidance: It provides a framework for designing and building environments, from entire towns to individual rooms, in a way that promotes human well-being and a sense of place. Interconnected Patterns: The patterns are interconnected, forming a \"language\" that allows designers and builders to create cohesive and harmonious environments. Focus on Human Experience: The patterns are rooted in observations of how people interact with their surroundings and aim to create spaces that support positive human experiences. Key aspects of a pattern language include:\nPatterns as Problem-Solution Pairs: Each pattern consists of a description of a common problem, followed by a proposed solution. Contextual Solutions: The solutions are not rigid formulas but rather guidelines that can be adapted to specific contexts and needs. Hierarchical Structure: The patterns are organized in a hierarchical structure, ranging from large-scale patterns (e.g., urban planning) to small-scale patterns (e.g., room details).

Matilainen (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"mailto:janne.matilainen@lapinamk.fi\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\">janne.matilainen@lapinamk.fi</a>) University of Lapland - Faculty of Social Sciences\nLapland University of Applied Sciences - Smart Built Environment Research field: Social Sciences - Management/Organization Studies\nKeywords (YSO): actor-network theory, innovation system, innovation policy, regions, research and development operations, university of applied science The Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) in Finland have an applied and regional role in the Finnish innovation systems. Their research, development and innovation (RDI) activities are changing, gaining maturity and beginning to find their characteristic ways of operation. One of these ways are the service concepts branded around some core demand or competence, which conduct RDI in co-operation with small and medium enterprises (SME) utilizing applied and practical methods. Their purpose is to aid commercial actors with their industry-recognized problems to grow regional competitiveness.<br>\nThis research aims to understand how these applied RDI service concepts work socio-technically, and to examine their role in their respective UAS and more broadly in different systems of innovation. The research adopts a social constructivist views of technical innovation to explain the inner workings of these RDI organizations in relation to relevant innovation systems. Main theoretical backgrounds and lenses are those of <a data-href=\"actor-network theory\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/ant-and-after/actor-network-theory.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">actor-network theory</a> (ANT) and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Innovation System\" data-href=\"Innovation System\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/si/innovation-system.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">systems of innovation</a> (SI).<br>\nThe research is a case study with an <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"ethnography\" data-href=\"ethnography\" href=\"literature-survey/methodology/ethnography.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ethnographic</a> nature, based on ANT, avoiding purely social or technological explanations. The study utilizes traditional qualitative methods associated with ethnographies. The case to be studied are the service concepts of TEQU and Frostbit in Lapland UAS. The deliverable result is a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"account\" data-href=\"account\" href=\"literature-survey/methodology/account.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">rich description</a> about <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"actor-network\" data-href=\"actor-network\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/ant-and-after/actor-network.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">networks</a>, interactions and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"translation\" data-href=\"translation\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/ant-and-after/translation.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">translations</a> in and with these technologically oriented RDI organizations and the identified innovation systems.\nThese objectives can be valued as societal, as the UASâs RDI role in the national innovation system is in motion. Innovation systems can be seen as complex networks of actors and institutions that interact to create, facilitate and disseminate knowledge. The impacts pursued with this study are to evoke discussion in both theoretical and societal dimensions. Theoretical discussions this research contributes are innovation management and diffusion of innovations. Societal discussion it partakes in is innovation policy and the role of UASâs in innovation systems in Finland.\nPremise underpinning the research: The project is a continuum of previous research done about Finnish UASs, RDI and innovation systems.\nResearchâs premise is that the Finnish UASs ways of practicing RDI with SME-oriented service concepts enacts innovation systems. It's also assumed that instead of purely technological or academic work they construct solution-oriented socio-technical ensembles that differ from the more traditionally held linear innovation models. Research questions: in the context of public-private RDI-activities performed by the Lapland UAS' RDI concepts in regional settings. What are the actor-networks of the RDI service concepts? What do they consist of and how are they formed and maintained?\nHow they define goals and what leads to their perceived success or failure?\nWhat are the key characteristics that enable or constrain their innovation processes? How do they relate to some perceived \"innovation systems\"? Do the RDI-activities enact innovation systems?\nWhat is their role in regional competitiveness?\nWhat kinds of models of innovation do they hold? <br>See attached <a data-href=\"Toulmin Argument\" href=\"research-plan/toulmin-argument.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Toulmin Argument</a>.\nExpected research results: The aim and objective of this project is to create an ANT and SI inspired rich socio-technical ethnographic description about these kinds of service concepts (case studies: TEQU &amp; Frostbit of Lapland UAS) in relation to and their roles in systems of innovation. Work plan and schedule: The project is to be done as a part-time research, working full-time with the Lapland UAS.\n<br>See <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://timeline.markwhen.com#mw=Cj4gWyFpbmZvXSAKPiBXcml0dGVuIGluIFtNYXJrd2hlbl0oaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXJrd2hlbi5jb20vKS4gVmlzdWFsIHJlcHJlc2VudGF0aW9uIGluIE9iaXNpZGFuLXBsdWdpbiBhbmQgd2Vidmlld2VyLgo+IFBhc3QgZXZlbnRzIHdpbGwgYmUgc2NoZWR1bGVkICJhcyBidWlsdCIgZm9yIGxvZ2dpbmcgcHVycG9zZXMuCgpncm91cCBGb3VuZGF0aW9uCjIwMjU6IExpdGVyYXR1cmUgc3VydmV5CjIwMjUtMDYvMjAyNTogRnJhbWV3b3JrIGRlc2lnbgoyMDI1LzIwMjY6IFRVS08gQ291cnNlcwoyMDI2LzIwMjctMDY6IE90aGVyIENvdXJzZXMKZW5kZ3JvdXAKCmdyb3VwIERhdGEgYWNxdWlzaXRpb24KMjAyNS0wNi8yMDI1OiBNZXRob2RzIGRlc2lnbgoyMDI1LTA5LzIwMjctMDY6IE9ic2VydmF0aXZlCjIwMjY6IEludGVydmlld3MgYW5kIHN1cnZleXMKMjAyNi8yMDI3OiBEb2N1bWVudHMKZW5kZ3JvdXAKCmdyb3VwIEFuYWx5c2lzCjIwMjYtMDYvMjAyNzogQW5hbHlzaXMKMjAyNy0wNi8yMDI4LTA1OkRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIGZvcm1hdGlvbgplbmRncm91cAoKZ3JvdXAgUHVibGljYXRpb25zCjIwMjg6IE1vbm9ncmFwaAoyMDI2OiBXaWRlLWF1ZC4gRS9ECjIwMjc6IFByb2YuIEQvQgowNC8yMDI1LTIwMjg6IERpZ2l0YWwgR2FyZGVuCmVuZGdyb3Vw\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://timeline.markwhen.com#mw=Cj4gWyFpbmZvXSAKPiBXcml0dGVuIGluIFtNYXJrd2hlbl0oaHR0cHM6Ly9tYXJrd2hlbi5jb20vKS4gVmlzdWFsIHJlcHJlc2VudGF0aW9uIGluIE9iaXNpZGFuLXBsdWdpbiBhbmQgd2Vidmlld2VyLgo+IFBhc3QgZXZlbnRzIHdpbGwgYmUgc2NoZWR1bGVkICJhcyBidWlsdCIgZm9yIGxvZ2dpbmcgcHVycG9zZXMuCgpncm91cCBGb3VuZGF0aW9uCjIwMjU6IExpdGVyYXR1cmUgc3VydmV5CjIwMjUtMDYvMjAyNTogRnJhbWV3b3JrIGRlc2lnbgoyMDI1LzIwMjY6IFRVS08gQ291cnNlcwoyMDI2LzIwMjctMDY6IE90aGVyIENvdXJzZXMKZW5kZ3JvdXAKCmdyb3VwIERhdGEgYWNxdWlzaXRpb24KMjAyNS0wNi8yMDI1OiBNZXRob2RzIGRlc2lnbgoyMDI1LTA5LzIwMjctMDY6IE9ic2VydmF0aXZlCjIwMjY6IEludGVydmlld3MgYW5kIHN1cnZleXMKMjAyNi8yMDI3OiBEb2N1bWVudHMKZW5kZ3JvdXAKCmdyb3VwIEFuYWx5c2lzCjIwMjYtMDYvMjAyNzogQW5hbHlzaXMKMjAyNy0wNi8yMDI4LTA1OkRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIGZvcm1hdGlvbgplbmRncm91cAoKZ3JvdXAgUHVibGljYXRpb25zCjIwMjg6IE1vbm9ncmFwaAoyMDI2OiBXaWRlLWF1ZC4gRS9ECjIwMjc6IFByb2YuIEQvQgowNC8yMDI1LTIwMjg6IERpZ2l0YWwgR2FyZGVuCmVuZGdyb3Vw\" target=\"_self\">attached link</a> to the Gantt-chart. Research data and methods: Observation notes, interviews, surveys and public &amp; internal documents.\nThe rich description is constructed with qualitative ethnographic methods, utilizing an actor-network theory -type of framework. The data to form this description is collected with participative and non-participative observations, interviews and surveys. Document analysis is also used to aid and supplement the qualitative interpretation.\nNo codified preliminary data, but a six-year working experience about the RDI service concepts in question, which hastens the formal observatory methodsâ implementation.\nShort comparative or enriching inquiries about The Research Institute of Measuring and Modelling for the Built Environment (MeMo) and Jamk University of Applied Sciences are also possible.\nInformed consent is gathered from the participants, and their right and ways to modify or withdraw that consent is informed and ensured. Data considering any participants/subjects is anonymized and handled according to good practices on the type of data in question. Monograph: A body of texts will be produced in hypertext/markdown format in Obisidian environment.\nInterlinked body of hypertext builds a type of a \"Wiki\" or \"pattern language\" about the research. The monograph will be compiled mainly from these texts. Risk assessment: Main risk for implementation is the possible delay of the project due to part-time research. The research is thus designed to have as little timing-sensitive parts as possible, to enable flexible and resilient implementation.\nNo ethical issues or ethical reviews foreseen. Self- and faculty monitoring practiced. Scientific: The scientific impact pursued with this research is to âopen the black boxâ of RDI in Finnish UASs in regional systems of innovation. It aims to renew the discussion about technically oriented RDI work in these types of institutions and their stakeholders, with not purely technological or social reasons, but taking to account them both.\nAccording to bibliometric searches there is little research about these types of organizations in frameworks of ANT and management, but the project is not novel as an ANT or STS study and no special potential for scientific breakthroughs is expected. Open science: Open-access wide-audience publication (publ. type E/D) at the start/mid phase of the project to market the project and promote societal discussion. Lapland University Consortium open-access channels are preferred, in Finnish.\nOne publication in wider-audience professional or scientific publication (publ. type D/B). Open-access publications considering Universities of Applied Sciences are preferred, joint publication with stakeholders or academic partners favored, in Finnish or English.\nOpen-access publishing of Obsidian library/vault as a \"digital garden\", to communicate the research \"in the making\". Beyond academia: Discussion with Universities of Applied Sciences, Regional Councils and other RDI funders, SME's and RDI policy makers are promoted.

Design/methodology/approach Based on the research of reapplication of a âtecnologia socialâ (TS) of entrepreneurial education, this article explores the authorâs reflections on the adoption of ANT as a theoretical-methodological approach, highlighting the practical implications of a social material theory during fieldwork. Findings The adoption of ANT places the researcher in front of methodological issues not always foreseen in the research design. Four moments to a practical path through the engagement of ANT agency are highlighted: the network of actors, monitoring of actors, interpretation of data collected and writing results. These moments correspond to methodological issues that the authors faced during the practical journey of the research. At each moment, the challenge aroused is discussed and the methodological choice chosen to address the issue is presented. Originality/value The engagement with ANT has enormous potential in the study of management and organizations phenomenon, but its methodological implications in practice are still challenging. The authors seek to share this investigation and engagement in ANT so that other researchers have a reference and a starting point to employ and engage in this theoretical-methodological lens. Thus, it may be possible to anticipate certain difficulties in future research designs and to glimpse at potential developments and paths that the research may lead. . .\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Annotations","level":1,"id":"Annotations%%_begin_annotations_%%_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"zotero_literaturenotes/@bignettiactornetworktheorymethodological2023.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1741029711165,"modifiedTime":1741030171619,"sourceSize":3066,"sourcePath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@bignettiActornetworkTheoryMethodological2023.md","exportPath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@bignettiactornetworktheorymethodological2023.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"zotero_literaturenotes/@blokroutledgecompanionactornetwork2020.html":{"title":"@blokRoutledgeCompanionActornetwork2020","icon":"","description":"Cite\nBlok, A., FarÃ­as, I., &amp; Roberts, C.

It is the critical move par excellence, but also an act of appropriation. This essay suspends the urge to go after in preference for an exploration of the trajectory of that body of texts known as the sociology of translation. The figure of the perpetuum mobile is put into circulation through these texts in order to trace some of their more unusual and unfamiliar connections. These include a whole series of parallels with seventeenth century classical philosophy and with nineteenth century âsocial energeticsâ. Connections are drawn out by using three âtest signalsâ, which are sent on through the ANT canon: substance, force and time. Pivotal to each is the sense of how very different events and apparently diverse territories can be brought into contiguity, or folded up together. This contiguity needs to be performed rather than described, placed in translation rather than simply presented. The chapter concludes by tracing a way from the strange folds of ANT to the equally peculiar forms of early Psychology.\n. .\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Annotations","level":1,"id":"Annotations%%_begin_annotations_%%_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"zotero_literaturenotes/@brownperpetuummobilesubstance1999.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1743697171831,"modifiedTime":1743697171833,"sourceSize":2222,"sourcePath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@brownPerpetuumMobileSubstance1999.md","exportPath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@brownperpetuummobilesubstance1999.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"zotero_literaturenotes/@callonactornetworktheory2001.html":{"title":"@callonActorNetworkTheory2001","icon":"","description":"Cite\nCallon, M.

This turns out to be what we call the fluidity' of the pump (of its boundaries, or of its working order, and of its maker). We find that in travelling to intractable places, an object that isn't too rigorously bounded, that doesn't impose itself but tries to serve, that is adaptable, flexible and responsive - in short, a fluid object - may well prove to be stronger than one which is firm. By analyzing the success and failure of this device, its agency and the way in which it shapes new configurations in the Zimbabwean socio-technical landscape, we partake in the current move in science and technology studies to transform what it means to be an actor. And by mobilizing the term love for articulating our relation to the Bush Pump, we try to contribute to shaping novel ways of doing' normativity.\n. .\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Annotations","level":1,"id":"Annotations%%_begin_annotations_%%_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"zotero_literaturenotes/@delaetzimbabwebushpump2000.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1741026460364,"modifiedTime":1741026547131,"sourceSize":1950,"sourcePath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@delaetZimbabweBushPump2000.md","exportPath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@delaetzimbabwebushpump2000.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"zotero_literaturenotes/@jacksonanalyticalmethodologicalunderstanding2015.html":{"title":"@jacksonAnalyticalMethodologicalUnderstanding2015","icon":"","description":"Cite\nJackson, S.

Originally developed in the social studies of science and technology undertaken in the second half of the 20th century, ANT has increasingly been taken up in other arenas of social inquiry. Researchers working with ANT do not accept the unquestioned use of âsocialâ explanations for educational phenomena. Rather, the social, like all other effects, is taken to be an enactment of heterogenous assemblages of human and nonhuman entities. The role of the educational researcher is to trace these processes of assemblage and reassemblage, foregrounding the ways in which certain entities establish sufficient allies to assume some degree of ârealnessâ in the world. Aligning most closely with ethnographic orientations, ANT does not outline a method. However, it could be argued that a number of propositions are shared in ANT-inspired approaches: first, that the world is made up of actors/actants, all of which are ontologically symmetrical. Humans are not privileged in ANT. Second, the principle of irreductionâthere is no essence within or beyond any process of assemblage. Actors are concrete; there is no âpotentialâ other than their actions in the moment. Entities are nothing more than an effect of assemblage. Third, the concept of translation and its processes of mediation that transform objects when they encounter one another. Finally, the principle of alliance. Actants gain strength only through their alliances. These propositions have specific implications for data generation, analysis, and reporting. . .\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Annotations","level":1,"id":"Annotations%%_begin_annotations_%%_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"zotero_literaturenotes/@kampactornetworktheory2019.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1742576208191,"modifiedTime":1742578713321,"sourceSize":2637,"sourcePath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@kampActorNetworkTheory2019.md","exportPath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@kampactornetworktheory2019.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourreassemblingsocialintroduction2005.html":{"title":"@latourReassemblingSocialIntroduction2005","icon":"","description":"Cite\nLatour, B.

Or, more broadly, what is a good way of addressing intellectual problems? This paper explores the tension central to the notion of an âactorâ - ânetworkâ which is an intentionally oxymoronic term that combinesâand elides the distinction betweenâstructure and agency. It then notes that this tension has been lost as âactor-networkâ has been converted into a smooth and consistent âtheoryâ that has been (too) simply and easily displaced, criticised or applied. It recalls another term important to the actor-network approachâthat of translationâ which is another term in tension, since (the play of words works best in the romance languages) to translate is to also betray ( traductore, tradition). It is suggested that in social theory simplicity should not displace the complexities of tension. The chapter concludes by exploring a series of metaphors for grappling with tensions rather than wishing these away, and in particular considers the importance of topological complexity, and the notion of fractionality.

Pointing to an increasing awareness of ANT in sociological discourse, but assuming that it is more widely known than well understood, the article outlines some of the key features of ANT as an approach to social life, before addressing the tricky question of how these ideas translate into methodological practice. The possibilities of the approach are illustrated by reference to the author's own ANT-inspired historical research on the socio-material history of dairy milk in the UK, which is used as a point of reference and an example throughout. Particular attention is given to the practical method deployed in the milk study, namely documentary historiography, leading to a critical exploration of the use of ANT in the analysis of historical texts. This involves considering the nature of the relationship between texts and lived practices, and drawing out how ANT offers a distinctive way of seeing texts which challenges the standard ethnographic view of texts and fundamentally transforms the issue. Given that documentary historiography is not a method strongly associated with actor-network theory because it raises considerable methodological dilemmas, this provides one particular account of how such dilemmas can be managed or overcome. Social researchers interested in the potential of actor-network theory should be able to draw upon this in exploring the possibilities of the approach for their own work.\n. .\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Annotations","level":1,"id":"Annotations%%_begin_annotations_%%_0"}],"links":["file://C:%5CUsers%5Cjanne.matilainen%5CZotero%5Cstorage%5C98S77GBN%5CNimmo%20-%202011%20-%20Actor-Network%20Theory%20and%20Methodology%20Social%20Research%20in%20a%20More-Than-Human%20World.pdf"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"zotero_literaturenotes/@nimmoactornetworktheorymethodology2011.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1743438321682,"modifiedTime":1743438321682,"sourceSize":2702,"sourcePath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@nimmoActorNetworkTheoryMethodology2011.md","exportPath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@nimmoactornetworktheorymethodology2011.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"zotero_literaturenotes/@walshamactornetworktheoryresearch1997.html":{"title":"@walshamActorNetworkTheoryResearch1997","icon":"","description":"Cite\nWalsham, G.

When it's published, it can be described with terms such as <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/\" target=\"_self\">Digital Garden</a> or <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki\" target=\"_self\">Wiki</a> (without the possibility for reader editing).

The maturity of the content lives and that's kinda the whole point of it. Not a single note is permanent, fixed or \"ready\". Also not everything in my Vault will be published right away. This site itself is a static epoch of my Vault and has to be manually updated into the web whenever wanted to. The project has started: 1.1.2025\nThis site has launched: 7.3.2025\nLast web update: 13.6.2025\nWord count: 7506\nPage count: ~25 Currently working on: Literature survey (mainly ANT &amp; innovation), for Framework design\nMethods design Caution\nThe functionalities of this website are not perfect. Translating from Obsidian flavoured Markdown to HTML (with all the third-party plugins that i use) does not mirror my Vault perfectly. I focus on content, but will gladly hear of any hiccups in the user interface. Main problems are: Citations using Pandoc citation keys have their technical restrictions and might not be presented in the most conventional or human-readable format.\nSite's layout has it's quirks, for example mobile device accessibility is not good and listings may have unnecessary line breaks.\n<br>Schedules written in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://markwhen.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://markwhen.com/\" target=\"_self\">Markwhen</a> do not work in web view.

When facts or innovations fail to spread, the diffusion model explains this by stating that \"some groups resist\" due to e.g. vested interests, ignorance or even stupidity. These social groups are seen as passive mediums that slow down or absorb the impact of ideas, rather than actively co-producing or transforming them.<br>ANT scholars argue that the diffusion model is absurd because it ignores the active involvement of a multitude of actors in the making and spreading of scientific facts and technologies.

It is used to understand sequences of evolutionary steps in <a data-href=\"innovation\" href=\"literature-survey/framework/innovation/innovation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">innovation</a> and economic development, particularly how radical innovations create a basis for further adaptive and induced innovations, or to analyze industrial transformation, particularly in the context of business cycles <a data-href=\"@andersenApproachingNationalSystems2010\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@andersenapproachingnationalsystems2010.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"andersenApproachingNationalSystems2010\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/Innovation/Development Blocks.md\"></span></a>(Andersen, 2010).<br>An innovation can be seen as creating the foundation for a series of more or less adaptive decisions and activities over time. This framework combines a Schumpeterian \"push\" (from radical innovation) with a Schmooklerian \"pull\" (induced innovations and demand) <a data-href=\"@andersenApproachingNationalSystems2010\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@andersenapproachingnationalsystems2010.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"andersenApproachingNationalSystems2010\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/Innovation/Development Blocks.md\"></span></a>(Andersen, 2010)p.90). A core innovation introduces a \"jump in the degree of disequilibrium\", initiating a sequence of structural tensions and their partial resolution. These tensions often manifest as price and cost signals in various markets, asking for a \"gap filling\" to address revealed needs or problems in the related chains of production and use, which are also seen as innovative and risky endeavors. <a data-href=\"@andersenApproachingNationalSystems2010\" href=\"zotero_literaturenotes/@andersenapproachingnationalsystems2010.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"><span class=\"pandoc-citation is-resolved\" data-citekey=\"andersenApproachingNationalSystems2010\" data-source=\"Literature Survey/Framework/Innovation/Development Blocks.md\"></span></a>(Andersen, 2010).From these key insights we can conceive the following ordering:Note\nAt the core of a development block analysis is an particular innovation or a cluster of innovations. These innovations create new dependencies and relationships between different parts of the economy, such as new firms, new technologies, and new production processes. As a new innovation takes hold, it often creates imbalances and bottlenecks in other parts of the economy. These structural tensions create pressure for further investment and development to \"catch up\". The \"gap filling\" that results from this pressure is what drives the transformation process. Once the complementarities are fully established and the structural tensions are resolved, the block loses its potential for driving further rapid growth.\n...\nNetworky nature\nProcess\nElectricity

It was developed by Bruno Latour as a didactic version of Actor-Network Theory to train college students in the investigation of contemporary socio-technical debate. The scope and interest of such cartography, however, exceed its didactic origin. Adopted and developed in several universities in Europe and the US, the cartography of controversies is today a full research method, though, unfortunately, not a much documented one. To fill this lack of documentation, we draw on our experience as Latourâs teaching assistant, to introduce some of the main techniques of the social cartographer toolkit. In particular, in these pages we will focus on exploration, leaving the discussion of visualization tools to a further paper.\n. .\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Annotations","level":1,"id":"Annotations%%_begin_annotations_%%_0"}],"links":["file://C:%5CUsers%5Cjanne.matilainen%5CZotero%5Cstorage%5CKC8S4Y39%5CVenturini%20-%202010%20-%20Diving%20in%20magma%20how%20to%20explore%20controversies%20with%20actor-network%20theory.pdf"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"zotero_literaturenotes/@venturinidivingmagmahow2010.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750068501540,"modifiedTime":1750068501541,"sourceSize":1979,"sourcePath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@venturiniDivingMagmaHow2010.md","exportPath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@venturinidivingmagmahow2010.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"zotero_literaturenotes/@alcadipaniactornetworktheoryorganizations2010.html":{"title":"@alcadipaniActorNetworkTheoryOrganizations2010","icon":"","description":"Cite\nAlcadipani, R., &amp; Hassard, J.

Despite its popularity, ANT is considered a controversial approach in that it appears to promote a sociological perspective that lacks substantive political critique. This is argued to be particularly true in ANTâs âtranslationsâ in management and organization studies (MOS). In this article, we argue that the âANT and Afterâ literature offers the potential to develop such a political critique. In particular we suggest it presents the opportunity to develop an approach that de-naturalizes organization(s), has the ability to deliver critical performativity, and at the same time offer a reflexive approach to management and organizational knowledge. Using organizational examples, we argue that ANT and After can offer insights relevant to the development of a critical perspective on MOS, notably through its advocacy of a âpolitical ontologyâ of organizing.\n. .\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Annotations","level":1,"id":"Annotations%%_begin_annotations_%%_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"zotero_literaturenotes/@alcadipaniactornetworktheoryorganizations2010.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1751358252650,"modifiedTime":1751358252650,"sourceSize":2044,"sourcePath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@alcadipaniActorNetworkTheoryOrganizations2010.md","exportPath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@alcadipaniactornetworktheoryorganizations2010.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"literature-survey/framework/philosophy/modernity.html":{"title":"Modernity","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"literature-survey/framework/philosophy/modernity.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1751535215028,"modifiedTime":1751535215028,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Literature Survey/Framework/Philosophy/Modernity.md","exportPath":"literature-survey/framework/philosophy/modernity.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"zotero_literaturenotes/@latourpasteurizationfrance1988.html":{"title":"@latourPasteurizationFrance1988","icon":"","description":"Cite\nLatour, B.

In this timely book, the authors offer a precise introduction to the nature of national innovation systems (NIS), examining the history of the concept and its use in todays world.This book uses language appropriate for both social science and engineering scholars to offer an accurate synopsis of the emergence of the concept, its theoretical core and its evolution. It analyses both developed and developing countries in terms of their NIS and its application to current societal challenges, such as economic growth, inclusive development and environmental sustainability, in an increasingly globalized and interconnected world. Key features include:.Three authors from three different generations and countries offer an overview of NIS from around the world. Extensive use of examples from the Global North and Global South. Recommended in-depth reading after each topical chapter. Overview of future research challengesâ¢up-to-date review of the literature and engagement in current debates.Erudite and accessible, this unique book on NIS can easily be used for undergraduate and graduate teaching. It is a valuable, and much-needed resource for teachers, students and researchers at all levels.\"--Publisher's description\n. .\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Notes","level":1,"id":"Notes_0"},{"heading":"Annotations","level":1,"id":"Annotations%%_begin_annotations_%%_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"zotero_literaturenotes/@chaminadeadvancedintroductionnational2018.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1754581931192,"modifiedTime":1754581931192,"sourceSize":2283,"sourcePath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@chaminadeAdvancedIntroductionNational2018.md","exportPath":"zotero_literaturenotes/@chaminadeadvancedintroductionnational2018.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":110,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"zotero_literaturenotes/@panserainnovationgrowth2025.html":{"title":"@panseraInnovationGrowth2025","icon":"","description":"Cite\nPansera, M., Lloveras, J., &amp; Fressoli, M.
