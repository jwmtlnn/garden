<br>Abstract
Purpose
<br>          This study demonstrates a practical use of Actor-Network Theory (ANT), showing methodological, predictive and unforeseen issues that emerged during the data collection and analysis phases and how they were addressed during the development of this research.
        
        
          Design/methodology/approach
          Based on the research of reapplication of a “tecnologia social” (TS) of entrepreneurial education, this article explores the author’s reflections on the adoption of ANT as a theoretical-methodological approach, highlighting the practical implications of a social material theory during fieldwork.
        
        
          Findings
          The adoption of ANT places the researcher in front of methodological issues not always foreseen in the research design. Four moments to a practical path through the engagement of ANT agency are highlighted: the network of actors, monitoring of actors, interpretation of data collected and writing results. These moments correspond to methodological issues that the authors faced during the practical journey of the research. At each moment, the challenge aroused is discussed and the methodological choice chosen to address the issue is presented.
        
        
          Originality/value
          The engagement with ANT has enormous potential in the study of management and organizations phenomenon, but its methodological implications in practice are still challenging. The authors seek to share this investigation and engagement in ANT so that other researchers have a reference and a starting point to employ and engage in this theoretical-methodological lens. Thus, it may be possible to anticipate certain difficulties in future research designs and to glimpse at potential developments and paths that the research may lead.

<br>Abstract
In this paper we investigate the intricacies of an admirable water pumping device - the Zimbabwe Bush Pump B' type - so as to find out what makes it an appropriate technology'. This turns out to be what we call the fluidity' of the pump (of its boundaries, or of its working order, and of its maker). We find that in travelling to intractable places, an object that isn't too rigorously bounded, that doesn't impose itself but tries to serve, that is adaptable, flexible and responsive - in short, a fluid object - may well prove to be stronger than one which is firm. By analyzing the success and failure of this device, its agency and the way in which it shapes new configurations in the Zimbabwean socio-technical landscape, we partake in the current move in science and technology studies to transform what it means to be an actor. And by mobilizing the term love for articulating our relation to the Bush Pump, we try to contribute to shaping novel ways of doing' normativity.<br>

<br>University of Lapland - Faculty of Social Sciences
<br>Lapland University of Applied Sciences - Smart Built Environment


<br>Research field: Social Sciences - Management/Organization Studies
<br>Keywords (YSO): actor-network theory, innovation system, innovation policy, regions, research and development operations, university of applied science

<br><br>The Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) in Finland have an applied and regional role in the Finnish innovation systems. Their research, development and innovation (RDI) activities are changing, gaining maturity and beginning to find their characteristic ways of operation. One of these ways are the service concepts branded around some core demand or competence, which conduct RDI in co-operation with small and medium enterprises (SME) utilizing applied and practical methods. Their purpose is to aid commercial actors with their industry-recognized problems to grow regional competitiveness.<br>
This research aims to understand how these applied RDI service concepts work socio-technically, and to examine their role in their respective UAS and more broadly in regional and sectoral systems of innovation. The research adopts a social constructivist views of technical innovation to explain the inner workings of these RDI organizations in relation to relevant innovation systems. Main theoretical backgrounds and lenses are those of actor-network theory (ANT) and systems of innovation (SI).<br>
The research is a case study with an ethnographic nature, based on actor-network theory, avoiding purely social or technological explanations. The study utilizes traditional qualitative methods associated with ethnographies. The case to be studied are the service concepts of TEQU and Frostbit in Lapland UAS. The deliverable result is a rich description about networks, interactions and translations in and with these technologically oriented RDI organizations and the relevant innovation systems.<br>
These objectives can be valued as societal, as the UAS’s RDI role in the national innovation system is in motion. Innovation systems can be seen as complex networks of actors and institutions that interact to create, facilitate and disseminate knowledge. The impacts pursued with this study are to evoke discussion in both theoretical and societal dimensions. Theoretical discussions this research contributes are innovation management and diffusion of innovations. Societal discussion it partakes in is innovation policy and the role of UAS’s in innovation systems in Finland.<br><br><br>
<br>Premise underpinning the research:

<br>The project is a continuum of previous research done about Finnish UASs, RDI and innovation systems.
<br>Research’s premise is that the Finnish UASs ways of practicing RDI with SME-oriented service concepts is interlinks and participates in building innovation systems and their competitiveness, and that instead of purely technological or academic work they construct solution-oriented socio-technical ensembles that differ from the more traditionally held linear innovation models.


<br>Research questions: in the context of public-private RDI-activities performed by the Lapland UAS in regional settings

<br>What are the actor-networks of the RDI service concepts?

<br>What do they consist of and how are they formed and maintained?
<br>How they define goals and what leads to their perceived success or failure?
<br>What are the key characteristics that enable or constrain their innovation processes?


<br>How do they relate to some perceived "innovation systems"?

<br>Do the RDI-activities enact innovation systems?
<br>What is their role in regional competitiveness?
<br>What kinds of models of innovation do they hold?




<br>See attached <a data-href="Toulmin Argument" href="research-plan\toulmin-argument.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Toulmin Argument</a>
<br>Expected research results:

<br>The aim and objective of this project is to create an ANT and SI inspired rich socio-technical ethnographic description about these kinds of service concepts (possible case studies: TEQU &amp; Frostbit of Lapland UAS) in relation to and their roles in different systems of innovation.


<br><br>
<br>Work plan and schedule:

<br>The project is to be done as a part-time research, working full-time with the Lapland UAS.

<br>Research data and methods:

<br>Observation notes, interviews, surveys and public &amp; internal documents.
<br>The rich description is constructed with qualitative ethnographic methods, utilizing an actor-network theory -type of framework. The data to form this description is collected with participative and non-participative observations, interviews and surveys. Document analysis is also used to aid and supplement the qualitative interpretation.
<br>No codified preliminary data, but a six-year working experience about the RDI service concepts in question, which hastens the formal observatory methods’ implementation.
<br>Short comparative or enriching inquiries about The Research Institute of Measuring and Modelling for the Built Environment (MeMo) and Jamk University of Applied Sciences are also possible.
<br>Informed consent is gathered from the participants, and their right and ways to modify or withdraw that consent is informed and ensured. Data considering any participants/subjects is anonymized and handled according to good practices on the type of data in question.


<br>Monograph:

<br>A body of texts will be produced in hypertext/markdown format in Obisidian environment.
<br>Interlinked body of hypertext builds a type of a "Wiki" or "pattern language" about the research. The monograph will be compiled mainly from these texts.


<br>Risk assessment:

<br>Main risk for implementation is the possible delay of the project due to part-time research. The research is thus designed to have as little timing-sensitive parts as possible, to enable flexible and resilient implementation.
<br>No ethical issues or ethical reviews foreseen. Self- and faculty monitoring practiced.


<br><br>
<br>Scientific:

<br>The scientific impact pursued with this research is to “open the black box” of RDI in Finnish UASs in regional systems of innovation. It aims to renew the discussion about technically oriented RDI work in these types of institutions and their stakeholders, with not purely technological or social reasons, but taking to account them both.
<br>According to bibliometric searches there is little research about these types of organizations in frameworks of ANT and management, but the project is not novel as an ANT or STS study and no special potential for scientific breakthroughs is expected.


<br>Open science:

<br>Open-access wide-audience publication (publ. type E/D) at the start/mid phase of the project to market the project and promote societal discussion. Lapland University Consortium open-access channels are preferred, in Finnish.
<br>One publication in wider-audience professional or scientific publication (publ. type D/B). Open-access publications considering Universities of Applied Sciences are preferred, joint publication with stakeholders or academic partners favored, in Finnish or English.
<br>Open-access publishing of Obsidian library/vault as a "digital garden", to communicate the research "in the making".


<br>Beyond academia:

<br>Discussion with Universities of Applied Sciences, Regional Councils and other RDI funders, SME's and RDI policy makers are promoted.

Empirical observations reveal a network of heterogenous actors working in a setting that aims for the development of regional competitiveness.
<br>And since<br>Warrant
The flux of these actions constitutes as the practical enactment and materialization of social reality.
<br>On account of<br>Backing
Actor-network theory (and after) and innovation system studies.
<br>And because<br>Qualifier
These grounds can be seen as a description of the social reality of innovation systems.
<br>So<br>Claim
Finnish UAS's RDI concepts actively contribute to the construction and realization of regional innovation systems
<br>Unless<br>Rebuttal
We deny this type of description having explanatory power over the social reality.
